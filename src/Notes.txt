* Angular is framework based on javaScript and Typescript
* Framework- collection of library at single point
* library - collection of class & codes at single point to achieve specific task like bs,chart.js,jQuary,primeng
* It uses Typescript becoz javaScript is not fully supported to OOP's like java
* Features of Angular:-
    ~ It is used to create dynamic web application
    ~ clean and Loosely coupled
    ~ open Source
    ~ Separate HTML,CSS & TS files.
    ~ Code reusability.
    ~ Easy to understand and maintain
    ~ used for web as well as mobile
    ~ Component based structure
    ~ Support Routing
    ~ Support progressive web application (PWA)
    ~ Cross Platform
* Angular CL
I (command line interface)
    - This is used to create,modify,maintain and run angular project
    - used to create basic building block of project.
* Installation
    1) Download & Install node.js if already installed check version node -v

    2) Install Angular cli : npm install -g @angular/cli
    3) check installed properly : ng version 

    4) Create new project/application : ng new projectName
    5) To start/run the project go inside created project and : ng serve/ npm start
    6) Open your favorite browser and open the url: http://localhost:4200

 Day-2
*version 12.2.3 (major release, minor release, patch release)
*angular folder structure: 
	1) src:
		~This is the root folder of your Angular application.
		~It contains all the source code for your application.
		
	2) app:
		~This folder contains the main application module, components, services, directives, and other Angular-related files.
		~Components and services are typically organized into their own subfolders within the app folder.
		
	3) assets:
		~This folder contains static assets such as images, fonts, or other files that are copied to the output directory during the build process.
		~Any file placed in this folder will be served by the Angular CLI without processing.
		
	4) environments:
		~This folder contains environment-specific configuration files.
		~By default, it contains two files: environment.ts for development environment and environment.prod.ts for production environment.
		~These files export environment-specific variables that can be accessed throughout the application.
		
	5) styles:
		~This folder contains global stylesheets for the application.
		~It typically includes files like styles.css where you can define global CSS styles.
		
	6) node module : 
		~This folder contains all the npm packages and dependencies required by the project.
		~It is managed by npm and should not be modified manually.

    7) Package.json :
      ~It also includes metadata about the project, such as name, version, and author.
      ~This is the npm configuration file.
      ~It consist all libraries/packages with their version details.

    8) Angular.json :
      ~ It is an entry point of project
	  ~ This is the configuration file for the Angular CLI.
      ~ It also consist basic info about project

	9) main.ts :
      ~It is second entry point of project
      ~It consist of bootstrapping process of project : 
				platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
				.catch(err => console.error(err));
      ~It contain root module 
      ~It consist of environment of project 
    
	10) index.html :
      ~it contain root selector : <app-root></app-root>
      ~responsible of SPA 
	 
	11) tsconfig.json: :
		~ This is the TypeScript configuration file.
		~ It specifies compiler options for TypeScript, such as target version, module resolution, and output directory.
		  "compilerOptions": {
		"baseUrl": "./",
		"outDir": "./dist/out-tsc",
		"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
		"strict": true,
		"noImplicitOverride": true,
		"noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
		"noImplicitReturns": true,
		"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
		"sourceMap": true,
		"declaration": false,
		"downlevelIteration": true,
		"experimentalDecorators": true,
		"moduleResolution": "node",
		"importHelpers": true,
		"target": "ES2022",
		"module": "ES2022",
		"useDefineForClassFields": false,
		"lib": [
      "ES2022",
      "dom"
		]
	},
	
	12) package-lock.json : It keep track of exact version of all the dependencies.
		"dependencies": {
        "@angular/animations": "^16.2.0",
        "@angular/common": "^16.2.0",
        "@angular/compiler": "^16.2.0", }
	
	13) polyfills.ts
		~ The polyfills.ts file is typically provided by Angular CLI when we generate a new Angular project.
		~ It's crucial for ensuring that our Angular application works across different browsers and environments by providing necessary polyfills for compatibility.
	
	14) <router-outlet></router-outlet> : The component associated with the route is then rendered inside the <router-outlet> tag in the parent component's template. 
    -----------------------------------------
        Basic building block of Angular:
    1) module
    2) component
    3) Services
    4) Directives => cust directive, Attribute direct(ngStyle,ngClass), structural directive(ngIf
    5) Template 
    6) MetaData/Decorators 
    7) Dependency Injection
    8) Data Binding => Interpolation, property binding, eventBinding, two-away dataBinding
    ------------------------------------------





   3) Decorators=> 
   ~ Decorators tells to angular how to process on class
   ~ most common decorators are @Component, @NgModule    
   MetaData- MetaData is extra info about decorator

   4) Data Binding=>
   ~ Data Binding is used to static as well as dynamic data which will be displayed on the browser
   ~ means to use to communicate comp.ts to comp.html  

   There are four way to data Binding:
   i) Interpolation 
   ~ This is one way data binding (comp.ts to comp.html)
      syntax:{{PropertyName}}

   i
   i) Property or Attribute Binding
   ~ This is one way data binding (comp.ts to comp.html)
   ~ It binds the data with property or attribute of html
      syntax [attributeName]="PropertyName"

   iii) Event binding (comp.html to comp.ts)

   iv) Two way data Binding   
   ~ (comp.html to comp.ts) and (comp.ts to comp.html)
   ~ Import formModule and we used [(ngModel)] to bind the data
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
   DAY-3: [Directive]
   ------
   ~ Directives are responsible for adding and removing element or changing the behavior of DOM
   ~ There are 4 types of directive:
      1) Component directive:
         - Every angular must have one component and declared by @component
         - component directive have it's own template

      2) Structural directives:
         - It is responsible for adding or removing element from DOM
         i) @if(){}- It's act according to given condition if condition is true element will be added in DOM
         ii) @for(){} - This directive repeat itself for every element present in the list
         iii) @switch(){}- It is used to compare more than one expression at a time

      3) Attribute Directive:
         - It is responsible for changing behavior of DOM
         i) ngClass - we can provide more then one class using ngClass
                    - We can pass array value,string,object

         ii) ngStyle - Styling inline
 
      4) Custom Directive :=>
      ~ command to create : ng g d DirectiveName
      ~ with the help of custom directive we can create our own directive
      ~ with the help of custom directive we can write logic onces and implement all over the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day-4 (Pipes) : pipe i used to tranform the data.
1) build in Pipes : JSON, date , currency , lowercase , uppercase
2) custome pipe : ng g p pipe_name
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day -5 : Service
- code reusability, http calls, shared logic.
   ~ HttpClient is built in service used to communicate with backend.
   ~ It is also used to send http request and get the response.
   ~ We will get the response in the form of observables.
   ~ http can cancel http request.
   ~ Error handling capability.
   ~ http gives us -> get, post, put, delete.

   * Observables:
   ~ Observables are asynchronous or parallel flow of execution which can handle multiple events at a time.
   ~ Observable is not a part of core angular, this is feature of angular added from library RxJS.
   ~ Observable can handle three events or methods:
   ~ next(), complete(), error().
   ~ observables can also handle the errors.
   ~ observables can be cancellables.
   ~ observables are used to API integration to communicate with backend.
   ~ Observer is responsible for calling above three methods.
-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------
Day-6 : Inter component Communication:

	Used to pass the data from one component to another component.
	it might be parent child.
	It might be siblings.
	if it is parent child relationship then we have three options to communicate the data depending on the conditions.
	1. @Input: 
	2. @Output:
	3. @ViewChild:

	If it is siblings component then we have two option i.e. Service communication and routing.
	
	1. @Input: 
		It is @Input decorator used to send the data from parent to child component.
			// Parent Component
			<app-child [childMessage]="parentMessage"></app-child>
		It will use property binding.
	
	2. @output:
		It is decorator used to send the data from child to parent.
		It used an custom event or event emitter.
			// Child Component
			@Output() messageEvent = new EventEmitter<string>();

			sendMessage() {
			this.messageEvent.emit(this.message);
		}
		It is an event binding.

   3) @viewChild:
      used to communicate from child to parent like @output.
      Here child component will be injected into parent component.
      difference is that in viewChild we can take the control of whole child component inside the parent.
      with the help of viewChild I can access all properties and methods of child component.
      we can call methods and properties of child component inside ngAfterViewInit method only.
	  @ViewChild(ChildComponent) childComponent!: ChildComponent;

		ngAfterViewInit() {
		this.childComponent.someMethod();
		}
	
	
   4) Services: 
      We can do communication of component which doest have any parent child relationship with the help of service.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day-7 : 
*Constructor :=>
   ~ It is not an part of Angular life cycle.
   ~ It Create object of the class.
   ~ It is used for inject dependency.
   ~ It is not compulsory to write Constructor if we don't have any dependency.
   ~ If we are not writing constructor then also it is going to execute by default.

*Angular Life Cycle :=>
   ~ Angular life cycle is nothing but component life cycle. 
   1) ngOnChanges(): when ever any changes happen in input property then this method going to call.
   2) ngOnInit(): It is responsible for initialize all the variables of component inside the DOM.
   3) ngDoCheck(): It is responsible for the change detection in the component.
   4) ngAfterContentInit(): Initialize all the projected views or other component inside the main component.
   5) ngAfterContentChecked(): It calls when any changes detect in projected views
   6) ngAfterViewInit(): It calls when projected view and component view fully initialize
   7) ngAfterViewChecked(): It calls when projected view and component view checks and update
   8) OnDestroy(): used to clean up logic for component 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   DAY-8:[Promise]

   - Promise come from ES6
   - It is async as well as sync flow of execution which can handle singal event at a time
   - In promise we will get singal value as output i.e resolve or reject
       Resolved : successfully executed promise
       Reject : unsuccessfully executed promise
   - Promises are not concealable
   - It is used to manage async http calls
   - Promises gives surety about the output in future 

      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|    
      |        Observable									   |                   Promises			             |
      |--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------| 
      |- It comes from RxJs original JS                        |-It comes from ES6                               |
      |- It can handle multiple events                         |- It can handle single event                     |
      |- It is cancelable                            	       |- It is not cancelable                           |
      |- It has async flow of execution                        | - It is sync as well as async flow              |
      |- It is required to subscribe                           |- .then used convert into readble formar         |
      |- can handle next, error, complete                      |- can handle resolve or reject
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	- async and await are used to handle asynchronous operations.
	- async tell us that this function will return promise, inside async there is await which pause the function untile promise get resolved.
		async function fetchData() {
			const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
			const data = await response.json();
			return data;
		}

* Angular is framework based on javaScript and Typescript
* Framework- collection of library at single point
* library - collection of class & codes at single point to achieve specific task like bs,chart.js,jQuary,primeng
* It uses Typescript becoz javaScript is not fully supported to OOP's like java
* Features of Angular:-
    ~ It is used to create dynamic web application
    ~ clean and Loosely coupled
    ~ open Source
    ~ Separate HTML,CSS & TS files.
    ~ Code reusability.
    ~ Easy to understand and maintain
    ~ used for web as well as mobile
    ~ Component based structure
    ~ Support Routing
    ~ Support progressive web application (PWA)
    ~ Cross Platform
* Angular CL
I (command line interface)
    - This is used to create,modify,maintain and run angular project
    - used to create basic building block of project.
* Installation
    1) Download & Install node.js if already installed check version node -v

    2) Install Angular cli : npm install -g @angular/cli
    3) check installed properly : ng version 

    4) Create new project/application : ng new projectName
    5) To start/run the project go inside created project and : ng serve/ npm start
    6) Open your favorite browser and open the url: http://localhost:4200

 Day-2
*version 12.2.3 (major release, minor release, patch release)
*angular folder structure: 
	1) src:
		~This is the root folder of your Angular application.
		~It contains all the source code for your application.
		
	2) app:
		~This folder contains the main application module, components, services, directives, and other Angular-related files.
		~Components and services are typically organized into their own subfolders within the app folder.
		
	3) assets:
		~This folder contains static assets such as images, fonts, or other files that are copied to the output directory during the build process.
		~Any file placed in this folder will be served by the Angular CLI without processing.
		
	4) environments:
		~This folder contains environment-specific configuration files.
		~By default, it contains two files: environment.ts for development environment and environment.prod.ts for production environment.
		~These files export environment-specific variables that can be accessed throughout the application.
		
	5) styles:
		~This folder contains global stylesheets for the application.
		~It typically includes files like styles.css where you can define global CSS styles.
		
	6) node module : 
		~This folder contains all the npm packages and dependencies required by the project.
		~It is managed by npm and should not be modified manually.

    7) Package.json :
      ~It also includes metadata about the project, such as name, version, and author.
      ~This is the npm configuration file.
      ~It consist all libraries/packages with their version details.

    8) Angular.json :
      ~ It is an entry point of project
	  ~ This is the configuration file for the Angular CLI.
      ~ It also consist basic info about project

	9) main.ts :
      ~It is second entry point of project
      ~It consist of bootstrapping process of project : 
				platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
				.catch(err => console.error(err));
      ~It contain root module 
      ~It consist of environment of project 
    
	10) index.html :
      ~it contain root selector : <app-root></app-root>
      ~responsible of SPA 
	 
	11) tsconfig.json: :
		~ This is the TypeScript configuration file.
		~ It specifies compiler options for TypeScript, such as target version, module resolution, and output directory.
		  "compilerOptions": {
		"baseUrl": "./",
		"outDir": "./dist/out-tsc",
		"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
		"strict": true,
		"noImplicitOverride": true,
		"noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
		"noImplicitReturns": true,
		"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
		"sourceMap": true,
		"declaration": false,
		"downlevelIteration": true,
		"experimentalDecorators": true,
		"moduleResolution": "node",
		"importHelpers": true,
		"target": "ES2022",
		"module": "ES2022",
		"useDefineForClassFields": false,
		"lib": [
      "ES2022",
      "dom"
		]
	},
	
	12) package-lock.json : It keep track of exact version of all the dependencies.
		"dependencies": {
        "@angular/animations": "^16.2.0",
        "@angular/common": "^16.2.0",
        "@angular/compiler": "^16.2.0", }
	
	13) polyfills.ts
		~ The polyfills.ts file is typically provided by Angular CLI when we generate a new Angular project.
		~ It's crucial for ensuring that our Angular application works across different browsers and environments by providing necessary polyfills for compatibility.
	
	14) <router-outlet></router-outlet> : The component associated with the route is then rendered inside the <router-outlet> tag in the parent component's template. 
    -----------------------------------------
        Basic building block of Angular:
    1) module
    2) component
    3) Services
    4) Directives => cust directive, Attribute direct(ngStyle,ngClass), structural directive(ngIf
    5) Template 
    6) MetaData/Decorators 
    7) Dependency Injection
    8) Data Binding => Interpolation, property binding, eventBinding, two-away dataBinding
    ------------------------------------------





   3) Decorators=> 
   ~ Decorators tells to angular how to process on class
   ~ most common decorators are @Component, @NgModule    
   MetaData- MetaData is extra info about decorator

   4) Data Binding=>
   ~ Data Binding is used to static as well as dynamic data which will be displayed on the browser
   ~ means to use to communicate comp.ts to comp.html  

   There are four way to data Binding:
   i) Interpolation 
   ~ This is one way data binding (comp.ts to comp.html)
      syntax:{{PropertyName}}

   i
   i) Property or Attribute Binding
   ~ This is one way data binding (comp.ts to comp.html)
   ~ It binds the data with property or attribute of html
      syntax [attributeName]="PropertyName"

   iii) Event binding (comp.html to comp.ts)

   iv) Two way data Binding   
   ~ (comp.html to comp.ts) and (comp.ts to comp.html)
   ~ Import formModule and we used [(ngModel)] to bind the data
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   DAY-3: [Directive]
   ------
   ~ Directives are responsible for adding and removing element or changing the behavior of DOM
   ~ There are 4 types of directive:
      1) Component directive:
         - Every angular must have one component and declared by @component
         - component directive have it's own template

      2) Structural directives:
         - It is responsible for adding or removing element from DOM
         i) @if(){}- It's act according to given condition if condition is true element will be added in DOM
         ii) @for(){} - This directive repeat itself for every element present in the list
         iii) @switch(){}- It is used to compare more than one expression at a time

      3) Attribute Directive:
         - It is responsible for changing behavior of DOM
         i) ngClass - we can provide more then one class using ngClass
                    - We can pass array value,string,object

         ii) ngStyle - Styling inline
 
      4) Custom Directive :=>
      ~ command to create : ng g d DirectiveName
      ~ with the help of custom directive we can create our own directive
      ~ with the help of custom directive we can write logic onces and implement all over the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day-4 (Pipes) : pipe i used to tranform the data.
1) build in Pipes : JSON, date , currency , lowercase , uppercase
2) custome pipe : ng g p pipe_name
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day -5 : Service
- code reusability, http calls, shared logic.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day-6 : Inter Component communicate.
- Parent to child => @Input
- child to parent => @Output / @viewChild
